Assignment 2

In this assignment you will be implementing an interest point based matching algorithm. The algorithm you will implement will have three steps as follows:
A interest point detection step based on Harris corner detector. You will experiment with different patch sizes in this step.
A interest point descriptor using 16 histograms of gradients for the 16 sub regions (4 by 4) of the patch
A matching step based on sum of squared distances (SSD) between the different interest points in the given pair of images (data given below)
Dataset to be used consists of pair of images given in the directory over here.
